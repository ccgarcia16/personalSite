# Home/About/Portfolio

I created three separate pages, four if you include this read me. 

## Images

I included several images, many of which have hover effects or different border radiuses. 


## Content

```python
My content focused on my favorite painters and artists, as well as focusing on my interests, including music and descriptions.

I hope you enjoy the text for all its idiosyncrasies. I put a lot of my personality into it! 

Hopefully the music isn't too obnoxious!

I mostly wanted to flex my artistic side, as that is the reason I love CSS so much!

For any questions, feel free to reach out! I'm probably coding anyway!

## What Else Should I Say?

Not sure, so thanks again! Hope whoever sees this likes Lou Reed and the Pixies. If you do, great taste!
