	<h1>Nothing Is Confused, Except The Mind</h1>

			<p>My mission is to share my love of aesthetics through visual art displayed in code. To invoke feelings. To inspire, even through my own personal taste, something in the viewer that connects with them, perhaps something they will feel the need to share as well. But perhaps that is the purpose of all art, and if that's the case, I am nothing more than an overly inspired artist and this is my piece.</p>
		</span>
		<span class="child2">
			<p>To me, the beauty of art is most clearly realized in the pieces that detest explanation. Not everyone is comfortable with an inward look, with reflection, but in the face of a lack of meaning, we have no choice but to connect ourselves to the art, and ask, what does this mean to me? Beautiful revelations follow, complicated revelations, epiphanies and discovery. In that lies the most precious component to art. Self discovery.</p>
		</span>
		<span class="child3">
			<p>Perhaps that is why I've gravitated to art movements such as Surrealism and Dadaism. There is no such thing as a creation of ours that does not bespeak to our own inner turmoil, our own hell, our own miasma of experience. These snippets of truth often times visit us in dream, shrouded by absurdism there is a meaning nested in these cacophonous expressions of our minds. A mother's touch, a lover's caress, the jubilation of laughter. How clear they seem once we train ourselves to look.</p>
