                <h2>The Portfolio</h2>
                <p>Below you will find pieces of art that is TOTALLY made by me and not by my favorite painters and visual artists. All these works I definitely made, and if Google says otherwise, then it's just a ploy to sully my good name. Enjoy these pieces of art (again, created by me) and some contextual information behind each piece.</p>

                <h2>Le Ruban des exc√®s [The Ribbon of Excess]</h2>
                <p>This is an important work in Tanguy's oeuvre, as it began a trend into worlds packed with intricately drawn, bean-like forms. The bizarre shadows are indicative of a desert or Alien landscapes.</p>

                <h2>The Two Fridas</h2>
                <p>Completed shortly after her divorce with Diego Rivera, this portrait displays Frida's duel personalities. One is traditional, heartbroken, the other is independent and dressed modern. In her diary she said it was based from a memory of an imaginary friend from childhood. Later she admitted it expressed loneliness from her divorce.</p>
